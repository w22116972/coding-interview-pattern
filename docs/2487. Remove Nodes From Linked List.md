# 2487. Remove Nodes From Linked List

https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nodes-from-linked-list/

You are given the head of a linked list.
Remove every node which has a node with a greater value anywhere to the right side of it.
Return the head of the modified linked list.

### Assumption

- non-empty list


### Algorithm

1. To handle next greater value node, we build a monotonic decreasing stack
2. When next greater value node appears, top of stack should be popped out until the top of stack is greater than the current node
3. Now it is ok to connect to current node from top node in stack 
4. Add the current node to the stack
5. Repeat step 2-4 until the end of the list

### Complexity Analysis

- Time: `O(n)`
  - Each node is visited once while traversing the list and pushed/popped from the stack at most once
- Space: `O(n)`
  - A stack to store node's value
