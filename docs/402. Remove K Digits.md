# 402. Remove K Digits

https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-k-digits/

Given string num representing a non-negative integer num, and an integer k, return the smallest possible integer after removing k digits from num.

### Algorithm

To create the smallest possible integer, leftmost digit should be smallest. So, we will traverse from left and remove the digits which are greater than the next digit. 

1. Create a stack for storing the digits.
2. Traverse the string from left to right.
3. If the current digit is greater than the next digit, pop the stack. Else, push the current digit to stack.
4. Check if leading 0 exists in the stack. If yes, remove it.
5. If k is not zero and stack is not empty, pop the stack k times.
6. Convert the stack to string and return it. If stack is empty, return "0".
