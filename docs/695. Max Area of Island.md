# [695. Max Area of Island](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island/)

You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 on the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

### Assumption

- the length of the grid is at least 1
- `m` and `n` are positive integers
- `grid[i][j]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`
- `m` is the number of rows in `grid`
- `n` is the number of columns in `grid`
- `grid` is not null

### Algorithm

1. Use a variable `maxArea` to store the maximum area of islands
2. 3 ways to mark visited islands
   1. Use a hash set to store the coordinates of visited islands
      - S(O) = O(row x col)
      - Overhead of converting coordinates to string
      ```java
      Set<String> visitedCells = new HashSet<>();
      // mark visited cell by adding to hash set
      visitedCells.add(currentRow + "," + currentCol);
      
      private boolean isCellVisited(int row, int col) {
        return visitedCells.contains(row + "," + col);
      }
      ```
   2. Use a boolean array to store the visited islands
         - S(O) = O(row x col)
      ```java
      boolean[][] visitedCells = new boolean[row][col];
      // mark visited cell by setting the value to true
      visitedCells[currentRow][currentCol] = true;
      
      private boolean isCellVisited(int row, int col) {
        return visitedCells[row][col];
      }
      ```
   3. Use the original grid to store the visited islands by changing the value of land to water or dummy value
      - S(O) = O(1)
      ```java
      public static final char VISITED_CELL = '-';
      // mark visited cell by dummy value
      grid[currentRow][currentCol] = VISITED_CELL;
      
      private boolean isCellVisited(int row, int col) {
        return grid[row][col] == VISITED_CELL;
      }
      ```
3. Scan the grid, for each cell. If the cell is land and not visited, use DFS or BFS to mark the island as visited and update `maxArea`
