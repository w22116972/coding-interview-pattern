# [200. Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)

Given an m x n 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

### Assumption

- the length of the grid is at least 1
- `m` and `n` are positive integers
- `grid[i][j]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`
- `m` is the number of rows in `grid`
- `n` is the number of columns in `grid`

### Algorithm

1. Use a variable `count` to store the number of islands
2. 3 ways to mark visited islands
   1. Use a hash set to store the coordinates of visited islands
      - S(O) = O(row * col)
      - Overhead of converting coordinates to string
      ```java
      Set<String> visitedCells = new HashSet<>();
      // mark visited cell by adding to hash set
      visitedCells.add(currentRow + "," + currentCol);
      
      private boolean isCellVisited(int row, int col) {
        return visitedCells.contains(row + "," + col);
      }
      ```
   2. Use a boolean array to store the visited islands
         - S(O) = O(row * col)
      ```java
      boolean[][] visitedCells = new boolean[row][col];
      // mark visited cell by setting the value to true
      visitedCells[currentRow][currentCol] = true;
      
      private boolean isCellVisited(int row, int col) {
        return visitedCells[row][col];
      }
      ```
   3. Use the original grid to store the visited islands by changing the value of land to water or dummy value
      - S(O) = O(1)
      ```java
      public static final char VISITED_CELL = '-';
      // mark visited cell by dummy value
      grid[currentRow][currentCol] = VISITED_CELL;
      
      private boolean isCellVisited(int row, int col) {
        return grid[row][col] == VISITED_CELL;
      }
      ```
3. Scan the grid, for each cell
4. If the cell is land and not visited
   1. Increase `count` by 1
   2. Use DFS or BFS to mark the island as visited
5. For DFS
   1. Use a stack to store the coordinates of the cells to visit
   2. While the stack is not empty
      1. Pop out the top of stack
      2. Mark the cell as visited
      3. Push the neighbors of the cell to the stack if they are land and not visited
6. For BFS
   1. Use a queue to store the coordinates of the cells to visit
   2. While the queue is not empty
      1. Pop out the front of queue
      2. Mark the cell as visited
      3. Push the neighbors of the cell to the queue if they are land and not visited
