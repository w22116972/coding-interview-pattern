# 1010. Pairs of Songs With Total Durations Divisible by 60

https://leetcode.com/problems/pairs-of-songs-with-total-durations-divisible-by-60/

You are given a list of songs where the ith song has a duration of `time[i]` seconds.

Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by 60. Formally, we want the number of indices `i`, `j` such that `i < j` with `(time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0` .

### Assumption

- numbers are positive integers and greater than 0
- the length of the array is at least 1

### Algorithm

1. Use a hash map to store the remainder of each number divided by 60
2. Scan the array, for each number, find the remainder of it divided by 60
   1. If the remainder is 0, add the value of the key 0 in the hash map to the result
   2. Otherwise, add the value of the key 60 - remainder to the result
   3. Update the value of the key remainder in the hash map


### Analysis

- Time: `O(n)`
- Space: `O(n)`
  - a hash map to store the remainder of each number divided by 60
