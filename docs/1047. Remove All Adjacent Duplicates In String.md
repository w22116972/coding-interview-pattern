https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-adjacent-duplicates-in-string/

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters. A duplicate removal consists of choosing two adjacent and equal letters and removing them.
We repeatedly make duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.
Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. It can be proven that the answer is unique.

### Assumption

- non-empty string

### Algorithm

1. Use a stack to store the characters in the string
2. When the top of stack is equal to the current character, pop out the top of stack

### Complexity Analysis

- Time: `O(n)`
- Space: `O(n)`
  - a stack to store characters in the string
