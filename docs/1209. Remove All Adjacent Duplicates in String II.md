# 1209. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String II

https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-adjacent-duplicates-in-string-ii/

You are given a string s and an integer k, a k duplicate removal consists of choosing k adjacent and equal letters from s and removing them, causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.

We repeatedly make k duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.

### Assumption

- non-empty string and positive integer k

### Algorithm

We can use two stacks to store string and its count. Or we can use defined data structure storing string and its count in one stack.

1. Use two stacks to store the characters in the string and their counts
2. When the top of stack is equal to the current character, check whether the count of the top of stack is equal to k - 1
   - if yes, pop out the top of stack
   - if no, increment the count of the top of stack
3. Repeat step 2 until the end of the string

### Complexity Analysis

- Time: `O(n)`
- Space: `O(n)`
  - two stacks to store characters and their counts in the string
