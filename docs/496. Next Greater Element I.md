# 496. Next Greater Element I

https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/

### assumption

- Are all integers in nums unique?
- Is nums1 a subset of nums2?

### algorithm

1. To find the next greater element of `nums1` in `nums2` , we can construct a decreasing monotonic stack to identify the next greater elements for each element in `nums2` .
2. To expedite the process of locating the corresponding elements in `nums2` for those in `nums1` , we can utilize a hash map to store the index of each element along with its corresponding next greater element.
