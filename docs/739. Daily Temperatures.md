# 739. Daily Temperatures

https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/

Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

### Assumption

- Input array is not empty

### Algorithm

1. Initialize result array with 0 because if there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead
2. Build a stack to store the indices of temperatures that are waiting for the next occurrence of a higher temperature.
3. Use monotonic decreasing stack pattern to handle when a higher temperature appears at index i.


### Complexity Analysis

- Time: `O(n)`
- Space: `O(n)`
  - a stack to store temperature's index
