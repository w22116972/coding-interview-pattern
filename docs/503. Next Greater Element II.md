# 503. Next Greater Element II

https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-ii/

Given a circular integer array nums (i.e., the next element of nums[nums.length - 1] is nums[0]), return the next greater number for every element in nums.

The next greater number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, return -1 for this number.

---

### Assumption

- Not empty array

### Algorithm

1. Create a result array with `-1` as default value because if there is no next greater element, we will return `-1`
2. Create a monotonic decreasing stack to store the index of elements in `nums`
3. In a circular array, we can either traverse it twice or double the index with modular arithmetic to simulate the circular behavior. In this case, we will double the index with modular arithmetic.
4. For each element in `nums`, we will compare it with the top element in the stack. If the top element is smaller than the current element, we will pop the top element and update the result array with the current element. 
5. Repeat step 4 until the top element is greater than the current element or the stack is empty.


### Complexity analysis

- Time complexity: `O(n)`
- Space complexity: `O(n)`
