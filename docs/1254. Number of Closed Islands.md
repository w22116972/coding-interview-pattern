# [1254. Number of Closed Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-closed-islands/)

Given a 2D grid consists of 0s (land) and 1s (water).  An island is a maximal 4-directionally connected group of 0s and a closed island is an island totally (all left, top, right, bottom) surrounded by 1s.

Return the number of closed islands.

### Assumption

- the length of the grid is at least 1
- `m` and `n` are positive integers
- `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`
- `m` is the number of rows in `grid`
- `n` is the number of columns in `grid`

### Algorithm

Different between this problem and [200. Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/) is that the island is closed if it is surrounded by 1s.

1. Use a variable `count` to store the number of closed islands
2. Replace land with water if it is on the edge of the grid
3. Resolve it as [200. Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)
